## Who I am

I am a french Linux systems engineer, currently living near Paris.

You can find here some of the projects I have worked on, mostly in the past. This might be low quality, you have been warned :-)

However, as I am not a big fan of Microsoft, I also have my own git server hosted somewhere else (find it if you can!)

## What I do professionally

I work as a freelance systems engineer, on Linux infrastructures. 
I specialize in open source software, with an aim at data sovereignty.

Do not hesitate to contact me for specific needs you might have, I will tell you quickly if I can answer your needs!

## Studies

I have a master's degree in computer science, specialized in networks and systems. I graduated in 2013.

You will find more details on my website below.
